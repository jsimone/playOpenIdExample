# Play! framework open id example

This is a quick example app that shows how you can use Google Apps as an open id provider in a Play! framework application. It also limits the users that can log in by e-mail domain. If you have a Google Apps for your domain account this becomes a great way to secure internal applications that you want to run on cloud providers like Heroku.

This app can be deployed to Heroku as is. If you want your own clone of it go to java.herokuapp.com and put this git url in the custom git url box.
